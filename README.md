SQL + Tableau project analyzing global air pollution using BigQuery
# 🌍 Air Quality Analysis using SQL + Tableau

This project analyzes global PM2.5 pollution using BigQuery and visualizes it in Tableau.

## 📦 Contents

- `/sql_queries`: All SQL scripts used for data cleaning and analysis
- `/visualizations`: Screenshots of Tableau dashboards and charts

## 📊 Visuals Included
- Pollution map
- Top polluted cities
- PM2.5 trend
- Total available readings by year

## 📁 Dataset Used
- Source: [OpenAQ Global Air Quality (BigQuery)](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/openaq)


*Important Note on Data Completeness:*

The OpenAQ dataset used in this project includes air quality data collected across various countries and cities from multiple years. However, the data coverage is not consistent across all years:

Earlier years (e.g., 2014–2016) have fewer countries and readings

Recent years (e.g., 2018–2022) have broader global coverage

This variation can influence the interpretation of trends, rankings, and comparisons

Readers should consider this when evaluating long-term changes or comparing air quality between years. Visuals and statistics may be more reliable from 2018 onward, where the data volume is significantly higher.
